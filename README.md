###Purpose and Goal
I created a "how to" site regarding how to make Rice Krispie Treats. I thought about the holidays and what kind of treats I enjoy making. Although the recipe is quite simple, there are many fun holiday ideas including Rice Krispie Treats. This site was designed to show the reader what ingredients are necessary, the steps of the recipe, and some examples of holiday treats.

###Break Points
The media screens on my pages have a mobile view when the min-width is 
under 700px. The tablet view is when the screen is between 700 and 1000px, while 1000px and above is the desktop view. This utilizes mobile-first responsive web design. 
The home page has a two and three column image layout in the the desktop view with two pictures in the first row and then three pictures in the second. 
As the screen gets smaller, the images resize, get closer, and eventually stack on top of each other.
The other two pages follow the footer width guidelines as the page gets smaller.

###Column Layout
The home page as a three column lay out with three picture row underneath the two picture row.

###CSS Continuous Loop
The ingredients page has an infinite loop of a picture of a Rice Krispie treat continuously sliding toward the right, and then alternates to the left.

###CSS User Interaction
CSS user interaction would be when you hover over the links, they change color, as well as when you make the link active and once it has been clicked. 
All include different colors. 

###Background Image
The background image is one including some snowflakes - to keep up with the holiday theme.

###Visual jQuery Interaction
The page resizing function, the clicking on the image, and the clicking on the header were all made into jQuery interactions. 
I also included an appending of the word DONE after each step of the recipe, so one could click the button after completing each step and not forgot what step they had already completed.
